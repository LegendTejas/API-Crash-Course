# API-Crash-Course

## Overview

This repository is a comprehensive collection of learning resources and examples for **REST APIs** and **FastAPI**. It is designed to help developers understand the core concepts of APIs, implement them efficiently using FastAPI, and build robust web services.

---

## What is an API?

**API** stands for **Application Programming Interface**. It is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.

APIs are widely used to:

- Connect frontend and backend applications
- Integrate with third-party services (e.g., payment gateways, social media APIs)
- Automate processes and data exchange between systems

---

## What is REST?

**REST (Representational State Transfer)** is an architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods to perform operations on resources. The main HTTP methods include:

- **GET**: Retrieve data from the server
- **POST**: Send new data to the server
- **PUT**: Update existing data
- **DELETE**: Remove data

REST APIs are stateless, scalable, and widely used in modern web applications.

## What is FastAPI?

**FastAPI** is a modern, fast (high-performance) Python web framework for building APIs. It is based on standard Python type hints and is designed for:

- High performance (on par with Node.js and Go)
- Automatic interactive API documentation (Swagger UI / ReDoc)
- Easy validation of request and response data
- Asynchronous programming support

---

## Who is this for?

- Beginners who want to learn REST APIs
- Python developers exploring FastAPI for web development
- Developers seeking practical examples of building robust APIs
- Anyone preparing for backend or full-stack development interviews

# API-Crash-Course

## Overview

This repository is a comprehensive collection of learning resources, examples, and projects for **REST APIs**, **FastAPI**, and **Flask**. It is designed to help developers understand API fundamentals, implement them efficiently using **FastAPI** and **Flask**, and build production-ready web applications and services.

---

## What is an API?

**API** stands for **Application Programming Interface** — a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs define the methods and data formats that applications use to request and exchange information.

APIs are widely used to:

- Connect frontend and backend applications  
- Integrate with third-party services (e.g., payment gateways, social media APIs)  
- Automate data exchange and workflows between systems  

---

## What is REST?

**REST (Representational State Transfer)** is an architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods to perform operations on resources.  

Common HTTP methods include:

- **GET** – Retrieve data from the server  
- **POST** – Send new data to the server  
- **PUT** – Update existing data  
- **DELETE** – Remove data  

REST APIs are **stateless**, **scalable**, and form the foundation of most modern web services.

## What is FastAPI?

**FastAPI** is a modern, high-performance Python web framework for building APIs. It is built on **Starlette** for the web parts and **Pydantic** for data validation.  

Key features:

- Lightning-fast performance (comparable to Node.js and Go)  
- Automatic API documentation with **Swagger UI** and **ReDoc**  
- Request & response validation using Python type hints  
- Native support for asynchronous programming  

---

## What is Flask?

**Flask** is a lightweight and flexible Python web framework used to build web applications and APIs. It is beginner-friendly and provides simplicity with powerful extensibility.  

Key features:

- Minimal setup with an easy learning curve  
- Built-in development server and debugger  
- Support for Jinja2 templating  
- Large ecosystem of extensions for authentication, databases, and more
